# Command Line Basics

## `ls` Command
The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current working directory. It displays the contents of a directory and can show details like file permissions, file sizes, modification dates, and more, depending on the options used.

**Usage examples:**
- `ls`: Lists the names of files and directories in the current directory.
- `ls -l`: Lists files in a long format, showing detailed information such as permissions, ownership, and size.
- `ls -a`: Lists all files, including hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`).

## `cat` Command
The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the contents of files. It's commonly used to view the contents of text files directly in the terminal.

**Usage examples:**
- `cat filename.txt`: Displays the contents of `filename.txt` in the terminal.
- `cat file1.txt file2.txt`: Concatenates and displays the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` together.
- `cat > newfile.txt`: Allows you to create a new file and write contents into it directly from the terminal (Ctrl+D to stop input).
